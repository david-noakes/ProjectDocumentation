\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Otherwise an AttributeReleaseToken is required for all attributes not marked as \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93share without asking\u8221\'94. It may include attributes in the list that are marked as \u8220\'93share without asking\u8221\'94. If there are any attributes requested that require the release token, but are not included in it, they will not be returned. This will not generate an error, but a warning for each field that could not be released. }}
