\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Step Up widget provides a facility for the customer credential to be raised for the level of service they are accessing. It is used when the security level required by the agency (AAL) is higher than that supplied by the authentication partner (IAAL).}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Step Up process involves two factor authentication. Currently the code sent via SMS. A future release may allow for code sent via other means.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Correctly entering the code will set the session IAAL to 2. The identity will still require the ARAL to be 2 before the session AAL becomes 2.}}
